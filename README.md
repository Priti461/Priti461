A servo is a precision-controlled device consisting of a motor, feedback sensor, and control circuitry. It's used in robotics, remote-controlled vehicles, and other applications for precise movement control. The key to servo operation is its ability to maintain or reach a specific position based on input commands, making it crucial for tasks requiring precise movements.
